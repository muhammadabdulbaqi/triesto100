# triesto100 (https://www.linkedin.com/in/muhammad-abdulbaqi-14b660249/)
This is a game I created using both frontend and backend. Aim of the game is to try to use as few attempts as possible to reach a score of 100. Very very difficult


needed changes:
1) deploy
2) change game so shows when reached 100 -> exit screen // save highscore
3) change front end to make pretty
